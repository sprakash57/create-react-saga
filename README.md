3. Proper testing environment setup for React hooks.

Then you have come to the right place. You will get the most vanilla React experience ever. See the features section for detailed info.

## Donate

Ecslate is an open-source project. I have initiated this as self-starter. But I thought, it would be really helpful to people like me to use the same tool 
that I use on day to day basis. It takes lots of effort and hard work to add new features, provide support and maintain at the same time. Please consider donating if you think docsify is helpful to you or that my work is valuable. Your support will keep me motivated to keep ecslate alive. I would be happy if you can -

Show ❤️ by starring this repo.
